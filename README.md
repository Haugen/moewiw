# MOEWIW - The Most Over Engineered Website In the World

We have one goal! Become the most over engineered website in the world.

## What is this?

This repository contains what will become the most over-engineered website ever created. Starting with a simple `index.html` file, we're embarking on a journey to transform this basic web page into a monument of technical complexity.

## The Mission

Our mission is to take the simplest possible website and engineer it beyond all reasonable bounds. We're talking:
- Microservices architecture
- Distributed systems
- Containerization and orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines
- And every other buzzword and technology we can reasonably (or unreasonably) incorporate

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to see the current state of our masterpiece.

*Stay tuned as we embark on this journey of beautiful, unnecessary complexity.*
